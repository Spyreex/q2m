Copy all necessary files (audio, background, .qua files) into the "input" folder
Run "bash convert.sh"
Your files will be in the "output" folder
I have no idea how to make a zip into osz so you'll have to do that yourself, simply
select all files > add to archive > make sure to click "zip" > once it's done simply rename the extension to ".osz"

WARNING!
The output folder will be cleared upon running the script.

Requirements
idk you probably need linux command "gcc"
so
	apt-get update
	apt-get install gcc
